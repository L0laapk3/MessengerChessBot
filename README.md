# MessengerChessBot
a stockfish implementation for facebook messenger chess, written in python, for linux

UNFINISHED, it works but it has stability issues when conversations go longer. (tested on rpi 2B, might not be much of an issue if you run it on a decent linux pc)



# REQUIREMENTS:
-pyside: 'sudo apt-get -y install python-pyside'
